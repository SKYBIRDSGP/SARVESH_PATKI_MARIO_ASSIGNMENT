# SARVESH_PATKI_MARIO_ASSIGNMENT


this repo includes all the SRA_MARIO assignments completed by me.

- # Now Let us have a look at the MARIO Assignments completed by me.

 # 1. TURTLESIM ASSIGNMENT üê¢:
 - We were asked to draw a circle and a spiral shape using ROS and Turtlesim.Following is the video of the output of the circle(code is submitted separately in the same repo..)

- The next was the spiral drawing task(code is submitted separately

That was all about Turtlesim
Now let's move to next Assignment:

# 2. FORWARD KINEMATICS ASSIGNMENT ‚ûï‚ûñ‚ûó‚úñÔ∏è :
- Thereare two assignments as far as Forward Kinematics is concerned: 
  1. DH Parameters : It's PDF is seperately uploaded in the same repository.
  2. Numericals :
     In the Following Way the Numericals are Solved:

**Questions based on 2D Rotations**

**Q.1.** If A (2, 3) is rotated in the clockwise direction by 90 degrees, what are the coordinate values?
### Solution:
Given : The point A=(2,3)=(x,y)
 -   Direction = Clockwise i.e Angle Theta = -Theta = -90 degrees
 -    Thus using the Forward Kinematics Formula for 2D rotations :
 - **New coordinates come out to be : (3,-2)** __________(ANSWER)
 - 

**Q.2.** If B (1, -2) is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by 60 degrees, what are the coordinate values?
### Solution:
Given : The point A=(1,-2)=(x,y)
 -   Direction = Counter Clockwise i.e Angle Theta = +Theta = +60
 -    Thus using the Forward Kinematics Formula for 2D rotations :
 - **New coordinates come out to be : (2.23,-0.13)** __________(ANSWER)
 - 
**Questions based on 3D Rotations**

**Q.1.** If A (5, 2, 6) is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by 180 degrees about the x-axis, what are the coordinate values?
### Solution
Given : The point A=(5,2,6)=(x,y,z)
 -   Direction = Counter Clockwise i.e Angle Theta = +Theta = +180
 -    Thus using the Forward Kinematics Formula for 3D rotations :
 - **New coordinates come out to be : (5,-2,-6)** __________(ANSWER)

**Q.2.** If B (1, 4, -3) is rotated in the counterclockwise direction by 180 degrees about the x-axis, and then in clockwise direction by 90 degrees in y-axis, what are the coordinate values?
Given : The point A=(1,4,-3)=(x,y,z)
- Here we undergo 2 rotations .1st is along x direction.:
 -   Direction = Counter Clockwise i.e Angle Theta(x) = +Theta(x) = +180
 -    Thus using the Forward Kinematics Formula for 3D rotations :
 -    New coordinates after rotation in x come out to be : (1,-4,-3).
 -    Now we undergo a rotation in Y direction :
-   Direction = Clockwise i.e Angle Theta(x) = -Theta(x) = -90
 -    Thus using the Forward Kinematics Formula for 3D rotations :   
 - **New coordinates come out to be : (-3,-4,1)** __________(ANSWER)
  
  
  Have a look at how we actually did it :

# 3. DH Parameters Assignment :
Regarding this Assignment : A separate PDF has been upoaded for this in the same repo

# 4. GAZEBO BOT ORIENTATION ASSIGNMENT ü¶æ :
A separate PDF of thre same hass been Uploaded in the same repo.
# 5. CHATTER_LISTENER ASSIGNMENT üíª:
The Problem statement given was as follows:
- **Q.** Create two publishers which one publisher, that publishes two numbers and a symbol of mathematical operation which are provided by you on a topic, to another publisher and it in return should publish multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction of the two numbers to the different topic, and finally create a subscriber that displays the final output of the mathematical operation
 - **SOLUTION :**
 - The code of the same is uploaded in the scripts . And thus the Output of the Following Recorded was as follows:
 -

- Here we are running a Publisher code which is giving the numbers '5' & '10' & a sign '+' as input.

- Another code operating as both a subscriber of the above code as well as an another Publisher which Publishes the Mathematical Operator Concerned to that of the sign published by the First Publisher.

- The third code is that of the subscriber which prints the Output (of the mathematical operation) on the Screen.




# Thus in this way , we have completed all the M.A.R.I.O.Assignments üòÑ.
# THANK YOU üôèüèº
